A simulation of the ecosystem at Rossumoya
==========================================
In this project we simulated how the ecosystem at Rossum√∏ya develops through
the years. This is a island with different kind of landscape and animals that
interact with each other. On this website you will find all the classes and
methods that were used in creating the simulation. You will also find the
tests that were run in order to check that every class and method worked as
they should.
